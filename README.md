# Project Description
After user starts the game, word without article appears. There are three buttons for choosing the variant of answer. After  tapping one of the button, the hidden article, word, plural form and meaning of the word appear on the screen. If user chooses the correct one, the article shows up in green color and progress bars indicator increases(by 0.001 out of 1), if not the color will be red and progress burs indicator doesn't change. Than next button appears. After tapping it there the word changes randomly (the program reads all the words from file derdiedas.txt and gives a random word). All this process repeats untill the progress bar is full. By that time user will have learned a lot. More info: https://github.com/ainazimo/Article_Trainer/wiki

### Used Data Structure concept
I used queues. If user answers incorrect, the test case will be enqueued. When the user makes 2 mistakes, these cases appear one by one as next in main as a question and will be dequeued, so it is convinient to repeat weak known combinations of a noun and article.

 Is it der, die or das?   
 You seem like totally confused. Of course, you should have got the dictionary and just learned it. But… take my words, that’ boring. That is why you might  haven’t done  it and you are mixed up now. What makes your life harder is that there is no rules for detecting the article in German. That is a big problem: you may have a TestDAF or Geothe Certificate exams soon. It is obvious that it’s  important.  I’m sure, you would prefer not sounding weird when you are speaking German and not loosing points on exams just because of not knowing the article of some word. Me too… So, I’ve made an application to help you learn articles of most common 200 words. If you see there a word that you do not know, don’t worry, I’ve provided meanings of them and also plural form. I’m sure that solves your problem. You are going to like it.
