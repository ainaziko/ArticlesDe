 Is it der, die or das?   You seem like being totally confused. Of course, you should have got the dictionary and just learned it. But… take my words, that’ boring. That is why you might  haven’t done  it and you are mixed up now. What makes your life harder is that there is no rules for detecting the article in German. That is a big problem: you may have a TestDAF or Geothe Certificate exams soon. It is obvious that it’s  important.  I’m sure, you would prefer not sounding weird when you are speaking German and not loosing points on exams just because of not knowing the article of some word. Me too… So, I’ve made an application to help you learn articles of most common 200 words. If you see there a word that you do not know, don’t worry, I’ve provided meanings of them and also plural form. I’m sure that solves your problem. You are going to like it.
